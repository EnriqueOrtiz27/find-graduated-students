# find-student
A simple API to practice making projects in Go.

The program works as follows: you enter a name, and it looks for students who graduated from (ITAM's)[https://www.itam.mx] most popular careers.

I simply wanted to better understand go routines and channels, and in this program I was able to implement this. 


Notably, the matching process can be. greatly improved.
