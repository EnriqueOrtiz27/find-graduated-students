# find-student

I created this programa to better understand go routines and channels, so bear in mind it's somewhat primitive.

The program works as follows: you enter a name, and it looks for students who graduated from [ITAM's](https://www.itam.mx) most popular careers.


Notably, the matching process can be greatly improved, among other things.
